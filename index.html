                <h4>My Career Path</h4>
                <p>I discovered my passion for web development during my studies, where I learned the basics of coding. After acquiring skills in html, css, javascript, React, and SQL, I decided to focus on web development, more specifically on the front-end and back-end, which allows me to create complete and interactive websites.

					I had the opportunity to collaborate on several projects as a junior web developer. These experiences have given me a good grasp of tools such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React and SQL, as well as project management tools.</p>

                <h4>My Story</h4>
                <p>From an early age, I've always been attracted to the field of IT. Even after graduating with a master's degree in finance, my passion for IT drove me to acquire new skills in this field. What really pushed me towards web development was my desire to create solutions that have a real impact on users. Each project is a new opportunity for me to learn, solve problems and improve my skills. 
                In 2021, I created my startup, specializing in IT, where I offer my services to individuals and businesses.
                We're a team of three, including myself and 2 senior web programmers. Together, we work on website creation projects, business software design and offer high-quality video surveillance solutions.</p>
