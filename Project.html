            <p>
                Since our startup was founded, we have gone through several phases of specialization in different technological fields. Our first line of development focused on the video surveillance sector. 
                Right from the start, we offered complete security solutions for businesses and private individuals. 
                This included the installation and configuration of surveillance camera systems in various types of premises: corporate offices, retail stores, industrial warehouses, and private residences. 
                Thanks to our services, we were able to meet specific security needs by setting up high-performance surveillance systems, adapted to each environment, while guaranteeing ongoing monitoring and maintenance. 
                This experience has enabled us to gain an in-depth understanding of the issues involved in protecting people and property, and to offer state-of-the-art solutions to enhance our customers' peace of mind.
                <br>Today, with the evolution of technologies and the increasing digitalization of businesses, we have taken a new turn by entering the field of web programming. 
                This strategic shift responds to the ever-increasing demand from companies to develop their online presence and integrate digital solutions into their business model. 
                We now offer tailor-made web development services, from the creation of websites for small businesses, to the design of complex e-commerce platforms and interactive web applications. 
                By focusing on modern technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Node.js, we are able to deliver high-quality products, perfectly tailored to customer needs.
                <br>In short, our startup is committed to growth and diversification, leveraging our initial expertise in video surveillance to move into broader sectors such as office automation, networks, and now web development. 
                Through this expansion, we aim to become a key player in the technology ecosystem by offering innovative, customized solutions to our customers, while continuing to explore new technological horizons to anticipate tomorrow's needs.
